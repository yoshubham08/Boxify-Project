## Usage
To run the analysis, open the `Boxify Project.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to understand the data processing, analysis, and visualization techniques used.

## Results and Insights
The key findings from the analysis are summarized below:

- **Inventory Turnover:** The analysis reveals the average inventory turnover rate and identifies periods of high and low turnover.
- **Stock Levels:** Visualizations highlight the trends in stock levels over time, indicating periods of overstocking and understocking.
- **Demand Forecasting:** Predictive models provide insights into future demand, helping businesses plan their inventory accordingly.
- **Cost Analysis:** The cost implications of current inventory practices are examined, suggesting potential areas for cost savings.

## Recommendations for Businesses
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to optimize inventory management practices:

1. **Implement Demand Forecasting Models:** Utilize predictive analytics to forecast demand accurately and adjust inventory levels accordingly.
2. **Monitor Inventory Turnover Rates:** Regularly track inventory turnover to identify slow-moving items and take corrective actions.
3. **Optimize Stock Levels:** Use the insights from stock level analysis to maintain optimal stock levels, avoiding both overstocking and stockouts.
4. **Reduce Holding Costs:** Implement strategies to reduce holding costs, such as negotiating better terms with suppliers or improving storage efficiency.
5. **Leverage Technology:** Invest in inventory management software that integrates with sales and supply chain systems for real-time inventory tracking.
