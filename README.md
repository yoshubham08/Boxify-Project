Implement Demand Forecasting Models: Utilize predictive analytics to forecast demand accurately and adjust inventory levels accordingly.
Monitor Inventory Turnover Rates: Regularly track inventory turnover to identify slow-moving items and take corrective actions.
Optimize Stock Levels: Use the insights from stock level analysis to maintain optimal stock levels, avoiding both overstocking and stockouts.
Reduce Holding Costs: Implement strategies to reduce holding costs, such as negotiating better terms with suppliers or improving storage efficiency.
Leverage Technology: Invest in inventory management software that integrates with sales and supply chain systems for real-time inventory tracking.
